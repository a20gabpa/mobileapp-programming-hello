## Hello World!
I have cloned the repository for the first assignment in order to be able to make my own modifications. In this case I updated the strings.xml to change the standard message when opening the app. The new text is shown below code fragment below:

```
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">Before time began, there was the Cube.</string>
</resources>
```

The result from this code is shown in the included screenshot.
